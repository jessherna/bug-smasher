# Bug Smasher Game

Game mechanics
 - The bug randomly hops around the game area at a given interval
 - The player catches the bug by clicking on it
 - The speed of the bug increases as much as the player's score
 - The player is allowed to reset the speed if the game gets too tough
 - The player can start again by click "Reset Score"
 
Learnings from developing the game:
 - Movement of elements by setting coordinates
 - Designing a game UI
 - Clean coding with functions
 - Using Math.random() and Math.floor
